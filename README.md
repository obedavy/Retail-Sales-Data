# Retail-Sales-Data

📊 Retail Sales Visualization with Python

📝 Project Overview

This project explores retail sales data (Superstore Dataset) to uncover business insights through data visualization. Using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I created static and interactive charts to analyze trends, customer behavior, product performance, and profitability.

The goal is to demonstrate how data storytelling can guide business decisions and showcase data visualization skills for data science.

🎯 Business Problem

Retail companies generate thousands of transactions daily but often lack clarity on:

* Which products and categories are most profitable?
* Which customer segments and regions drive revenue?
* How discounts impact profitability?
* What seasonal sales patterns exist?

✅ Objectives

* Visualize sales, profit, and discount patterns.
* Identify high-value customers, categories, and regions.
* Explore profitability and discount strategies.
* Build both static and interactive visualizations.

📂 Dataset

Source: Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)

Columns:
* `Order Date`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, `Quantity` 
* `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`, `Region`

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Data Handling: pandas, numpy
* Visualization (Static): matplotlib, seaborn
* Visualization (Interactive): plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects

📊 Key Visualizations
📈 Sales & Trends
* Monthly sales and profit trend (line chart)
* Year-over-year growth comparison

🛒 Product & Category Analysis
* Top 10 products by sales
* Bottom 10 products by profit
* Category vs. sub-category profitability heatmap

👥 Customer & Regional Insights
* Sales by customer segment (donut chart)
* Sales by region (map)
* Treemap: category → sub-category → product breakdown

💸 Discount Impact
* Discount vs. Profit (interactive scatter plot)
* Profit margin distribution under different discount levels

🔑 Insights & Findings

* Seasonal sales pattern follows holiday sales.
* Consumer segment drives the revenue at most.
* Discounts above ~40% generally lead to negative profits.
* Furniture sales are strong but profit margins are lower compared to Office Supplies.
* The West region leads in sales (U.S), while the South shows stronger profitability.
